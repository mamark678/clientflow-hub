## Short Description (132 chars max)
Manage multiple client workspaces without the chaos. Switch instantly between client accounts and tools with one click.

## Detailed Description

ClientFlow is the ultimate browser extension for freelancers, agencies, and consultants who manage multiple clients. Say goodbye to the chaos of juggling dozens of tabs, logging in and out of accounts, and losing track of project links.

With ClientFlow, you can create dedicated workspaces for each client, complete with their color codes, specific tool URLs, and even auto-detected Google Account configurations.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **Organized Client Workspaces**: Create a dedicated card for each client with their name and custom color coding.
*   **One-Click Tool Access**: Store all important links for a client (Trello, Drive, Slack, website, etc.) and open them instantly.
*   **Google Account Indexing**: Stop fighting with "You don't have access" errors! ClientFlow automatically detects and saves the correct Google account index (u/0, u/1, etc.) for each client's Drive and Gmail links.
*   **Cloud Sync**: Sign in to sync your client workspaces across all your devices (optional).
*   **Privacy First**: Use it locally without an account, or sync securely via Supabase. Your data is yours.

### 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Add a Client**: Click "+ New Client", enter their name, and pick a color.
2.  **Add Tools**: specific URLs for that client (e.g., their specific Trello board or Google Drive folder).
3.  **Google Magic**: Paste a Google Drive link, and ClientFlow will automatically extract the account index (e.g., /u/1/) so links always open with the correct signed-in account.
4.  **Work**: Click any tool icon to open it immediately in a new tab.

ClientFlow is designed with your privacy in mind.
